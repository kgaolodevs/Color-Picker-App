A JavaScript Application that helps you pick custom colors for your application

## About
- The color picker app helps users create their very own custom color palettes. Colors are randomly generated, and users have the option to choose which ones to keep and save into a library. For each color palette, a hex-code is also provided that can easily be copied by clicking on it. Users can also adjust the Hue, Brightness and Saturation to further customize the look and feel of each palette. All libraries are saved to the user's local browser storage.
